Ensure version 1.24+ of Perl module Astro::Montenbruck is installed on the system

Download and unzip the distribution in a temporary place

Copy the module files

     ./script/phases.pl 
     ./script/planpos.pl 
     ./script/riseset.pl 
     ./script/rst_almanac.pl 
     ./script/solequ.pl 

Modify riseset.pl to calculate all three twilights
and call the new file:

     ./script/riseset_mod.pl 

to local dir './bin'.

Use Raku's 'run' or 'shell' to do required work.

General scheme is to do a calendar year for all four Perl scripts. The hooker is
the 'phases.pl' and 'planpos.pl' scripts need to be run one day at a time, in
that order. The 'planpos.pl' script can be run only after the 'phases.pl'
is run and the the output analyzed to get the Moon times of rise, set, and
transit.

Note we use the horizontal or "alt-az" coordinate system (number 6 in 'planpos.pl')
for the positions of the Moon.
