Moon illumination info in the Cal repository
(this supersedes that info)
============================================

Information extracted from file 'moon-illumination.raku':

Note the repo and the file have lots of Moon info and subroutines
for handling lunation.

The az/el horizontal coordinate system for astronautical use
------------------------------------------------------------

From Wikipedia:
==============

Altitude (elevation) is the angle between the observer's horizon
and the celestial object. For visible objects it is between zero
and 90 degrees.

Azimuth is the angle of the object around the horizon, usually
messured from true north eastward.

From Jean Meeus' book "Astronomical Algorithms"
Chapter 48
"Illuminated Fraction of the Moon's Disk"
p. 345
================================================================

k = (1 + cos iota) / 2; # Eq. 48.1

  where:

  k    - illuminated fraction of the Moon
  iota - phase angle

cos psi = sin decl-sun sin decl-moon + cos decl-sun cos decl-moon cos(rha-sun - rha-moon); # Eq. 48.2

  where:

  psi       - geocentric elongation of the Moon from the Sun
  rha-sun   - right ascension of the Sun
  decl-sun  - declination of the Sun
  rha-moon  - right ascension of the Moon
  decl-moom - declinaion of the Moon

tan iota = (R sin psi) / (D - R cos psi); # Eq. 48.3

  where:

  R - distance Earth to Sun
  D - distance Earth to Moon (same units as R)

  The angles psi and iota are always between 0 and 180 degrees.
  Once iota is known, the illuminated fraction, k, can be
  obtained from Eq. 48.1.

Position Angle of the Moon's bright limb

The position angle of the Moon's bright limb is the angle, chi,
of the midpoint of the illuminated limb of the Moon (C in the
figure on page 345), measured from the North Point of the disk
(not from the axis of rotation of the lunar globe). It can be
obtained from:

tan chi = [cos d-s sin(a-s - a-m)]
             / [sin d-s cos d-m - cos d-s sin d-m cos(a-s - a-m)]; # Eq. 48.5

The angle chi is in the vicinity of 270 degrees near First Quarter,
near 90 degrees after Full Moon. It can be found in the correct
quadrant by applying the atan2 function to the numerator and
denominator of the fraction in Eq. 48.5 (see "the correct quadrant" in
Chapter 1).

If chi is the position angle of the midpoint of the bright limb, then
the position angle of the cusps are chi-90 and chi+90 degrees.  The
angle chi has the avantage that it ambiguously defines the illuminated
limb of the Moon.

Note that the angle chi is not measured from the direction of the
observer's zenith. The zenith angle of the bright limb is chi - q
where q is the parallactic angle (see Chapter 14).

Finally, note that Eq. 48.5 is valid in the case of a planet, too.

Parallactic angle (Chapter 14)
------------------------------

By convention, the angle q is negative before, and positive after the
passage through the southern meridian. Exactly on the meridian we have
q = 0 degrees.

tan q = sind(H) / (tand(phi) * cosd(delta) - sind(delta) *  cosd(H)); # Eq. 14.1

  where:

  phi - geographical latitude of the observer
  delta - declination of the celestial body
  H     - the body's hour angle at the given instant

Exactly in the zenith, the angle q is not defined. That is the
condition of the observer being at the North Pole.

When a celestial body passes through the zenith, the patallactic angle
q suddenly jumps from -90 degrees to +90 degrees.

If the celestial body is on the horizon (hence rising or setting),
formula (14.1) simplifies greatly, namely

cosd(q) = sind(phi) / cosd(delta); # unnumbered equation

Definitions (from Wikipedia):

position angle - In astronomy, position angle (usually abbreviated

PA) is the convention for measuring angles on the sky. The
International Astronomical Union defines it as the angle measured
relative to the north celestial pole (NCP), turning positive
into the direction of the right ascension. In the standard (non-flipped)
images, this is a counterclockwise measure relative to the axis into
the direction of positive declination.

north celestial pole (NCP) - The north and south celestial poles
are the two imaginary points in the sky where the Earth's axis of
rotation, indefinitely extended,  appear permanently directly overhead
to observers at the Earth's North Pole and South Pole, respectively.
As the Earth spins on its axis, the two celestial poles remain
fixed in the sky, and all other celestial points appear to rotate
around them, completing one circuit per day (strictly, per sidereal day).

parallactic angle - In spherical astronomy, the parallactic angle is the
angle between the great circle through a celestial object and the zenith,
and the hour circle of the object. It is usually denoted q. In the
triangle zenith-object-celestial pole, the parallactic angle will be
the position angle of the zenith at the celestial object. Despite its
name, this angle is unrelated with parallax. The parallactic angle is
zero or 180 degrees when the object crosses the meridian.

hour circle - the great circle through the object and the celestial poles
