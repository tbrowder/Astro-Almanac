=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Astro::Almanac> provides daily observation data on the Sun, Moon,
and planets, all output as a JSON file named C<astro-data.json>.

Under the covers it uses one fine Perl module thanks to the
excellent Raku module C<Inline::Perl5>. To install the Perl module
execute:

=code
# cpanm Astro::Montenbruck

=head1 CREDITS

The author is indebted to I<Sergey Krushinsky>, the author of the
excellent aid for amateur astronomers, the Perl module C<Astro::Montenbruck>,
available on [CPAN](https://cpan.org). Sergey was very kind and helpful to me
during my learning the rudiments of his module, and was always willing
to listen to my suggestions as a novice user. His module, to me,
is like a I<Swiss Army Knife> for astronomers.
