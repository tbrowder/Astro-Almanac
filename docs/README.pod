=head1 CREDITS

The author is indebted to I<Sergey Krushinsky>, the author of the
excellent aid for amateur astronomers, the Perl module B<Astro::Montenbruck>,
available on [CPAN](https://cpan.org). Sergey was very kind and helpful to me
during my learning the rudiments of his module, and was always willing
to listen to my suggestions as a novice user. His module, to me,
is like a I<Swiss Army Knife> for astronomers.
